# Stancon2018_Alzheimers

Stancon submission. Run Rmarkdown notebook (requires Tidyverse, MCMCpack, and Ryacas library). For some reason plotting the M-Splines requires Purrr 0.2.3, (0.2.2.2 produces a bug that makes the plots appear incorrectly). For future reference I also used 

ggplot2: 2.2.1
tidyverse: 1.1.1
